			<p>With a grand sense of adventure, Charles and Ray Eames turned their curiosity and boundless enthusiasm into creations that established them as a truly great husband and wife design team. Their unique synergy led to a whole new look in furniture. Lean and modern. Playful and funtional. Sleek, sophisticated and beautifully simple. That was and is the "Eames look".</p>

			<p>That look and their relationship with Herman Miller started with moulded plywood chairs in th late 1940s and included the world-renowed Eames lounge chair, now in the permanent collection of the Museum of Mordern Art in New York</p>

			<p>Charles and Ray achieved their monumental sucess by approaching each project the same way : Does it interest and untrigue us? Can we make it better?</p>
				
			<p class="personal-quote">"Choose your corner, pick away at it carefully, intensely &amp; to the best of your ability, &amp; that way, you might change the world" <br> <span>- Charles Eames</span><p>

			<p>The loved their work, which was a combination of art and science, design and architecture, process and product, style and function."The details are not details", said Charles. "They make the product".</p>

			<p>Their own concepts evloved over time, not overnight. As Charles noted about the development of the Mouled Plywood Chairs, "Yes, it was a flash of inspiration", he said, "a kind of 30- year flash".</p>

			<p>A design critic ounce said that this extraordinary couple "just wanted to make the world a better place". That they did. That also made it a lot more interesting.</p>
